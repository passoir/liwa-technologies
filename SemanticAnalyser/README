/***************************************************************************/

The Semantic Analyser consists of two main classes: 
 - CPESetup.ARCCollectionParserCPM is used to parse a collection of ARC archives. It reads all the files of text/html 
 mimetype from archives and it extracts all the nouns appearing around conjunctions in the text. It then 
 stores the lemmas of the nouns plus location information in a MySQL database. It takes as input either the URL
 where the archives are listed, or the folder with the archives and the number of archives to be processed.  
 - graphs.CreateGraphs is used to extract lemma co-occurrence matrixes for different time intervals from
 the database. 
 
 If either of the programs is called without arguments, it will print information about its usage. 
 
Requirements:
 
  - Operating system: Linux
  - Memory: 2G
  - Java version: 1.6.x
  - MySQL database
 
Installation: 
  
  The SemanticAnalyser itself requires no special installation, but due to licensing issues, the additionally 
  needed packages cannot be distributed with the package. 
  
  - UIMA from http://uima.apache.org/ has to be priorly installed on the system and the environment variable
  has to be set using the following command, assuming that you have extracted UIMA to the directory /opt:
  
  		export UIMA_HOME=/opt/apache-uima
  
  - TreeTagger from http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/ has to be installed on the
  platform and then again the environment variable TAGDIR has to be set, assuming that you have extracted TreeTagger
  to the directory /opt: 
  
  		export TAGDIR=/data/iofciu/uimatools/TreeTagger
  
  Also download the following model files for your platform and place them in to the models 
  sub-directory of your TreeTagger directory:
		â€¢ English parameter file (gzip compressed, Latin1)
  
  - DKPro from http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/?id=2643 has to be extracted on the platform. The variable 
  DKProWorkspace has to be set, assuming that DKPro was extracted in \opt:
 
 
 		export DKproWorkspace=/opt/DKPRo-UGD/workspace
 		
 The environment variables will be set only in the terminal window in which you have issued
the command. You need to start the SemanticAnalyser from the very same terminal window later.

Database setup:

In order to setup the database connection the script __liwa__mysql.sql has to be run on the MySql server. 
This will create the needed database schema. The credentials for connecting to the database have then to be written in the properties file db.properties found in src/de/l3s/database/

Running:

First two Jars have to be created, one for extracting the information from archives (using as main class ARCCollectionParserCPMPharos.java from src/CPESetup/) and one for extracting the co-occurrence graphs (with main class src/graphs/CreateGraphs.java)

 - command for information extraction:

java -jar -Xms3G SemanticAnalyser_reader.jar p path_to_archive_directory number_of_archives_to_be_read

- command for graph extraction:

java -jar -Xms3G SemanticAnalyser_graphs.jar beginning_date end_date middle_date p

where dates are with the form: 2004-01-01
and p for using the database from the properties file
